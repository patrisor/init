# The file which contains the RSA keys of systems authorized to
# connect via SSH is called:
/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# For this to work, we will need to first create a key with ssh-keygen,
# set a password, then create the folder above to store the new key. 
# This key represents the computer we will want to access using ssh.
