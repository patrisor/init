# The service we would use to schedule specific 
# jobs under a schedule would be the crontab tool.
# For example, to schedule a job for root, we would
# need to run the command "sudo crontab -u root -e"
# to enter a crontab configuration file. Next, we
# pick an editor to imbed a schedule and command in
# this format:
# [minute] [hour] [date] [month] [weekday] [command]
